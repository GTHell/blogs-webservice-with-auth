# Simple News/Blog Introduction

This is a simple website with authentication using passportJs with JWT and Local strategy. This application is trying to implementing the split stack, which mean there're a server folder and client folder which seperate files respectively to their folder name. The backend is implementing using ExpressJs and Sequelize for modelling. The pattern is MVC except the V is taking out so there're only models and controllers. The frontend is using Vue,Vuex and Vue-router with vuetify UI library.

# Why do I make this?

I want to see how much time wasted trying to write a really simple website with Javascript only stack. It appear that a great time has been wastet but what I find interesting is that it's kinda fun and cool to learn new trick and even though it's more time comsuming and a little bit confusing than PHP, I can say that it's a pleasant experience to be able to make authentication with Javascript and especially using JWT and Passport which is cool as hell!
